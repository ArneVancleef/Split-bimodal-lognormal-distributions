# Split-bimodal-lognormal-distributions
Python code to split bimodal lognormal distributions using differential evolution, specifically made for particle size distributions. The parameters and figures of the seperate distributions will be given after executing the code.

This code works by fitting the parameters of two lognormal distributions in order to split up bimodal distributions. 

Note that it is very important to adapt the bounds to your particle size distributions!

Can be adapted to split or fit unimodal or multimodal distributions.
